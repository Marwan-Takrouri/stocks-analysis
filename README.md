# stocks-analysis
***Project overview:*** 

The main purpose of this analysis is to help Steve’s parents decide on which green energy stocks they should invest. Steve would like to help his parents not only to decide on which stocks to invest but also to ensure making a good return on their investment. Steve’s parents are precisely interested to invest on Stock named DQ in Green energy. 
Analyzing with VBA has been widely used in the financial data sets. Through taking 2017,2018 data of the returns on prices of the DQ stock and all the other stocks, we will be able to help Steve and his parents to make a comparison so they can make their final decision.


***Analysis Summary :***

Screenshots of runtimes are included for 2017 and 2018 with the original code, as well as for the refactored code. In this circumstance, the runtime were a touch slower for the refactored code, as per below:

***Results :***

* In 2017 the DQ stock returns with about 199% , while in 2018 it dropped with 62.6%.It was the best return in 2017 and the lowest in 2018.
* While taking in consideration return of investment: it is better to avoid DQ and thinking on investing in ENPH instead.
* The advantages of refactoring code are to make it run more efficiently and quicker.However,refatoring can also make the code more clear for others to read.
* The goal for the refactored code was to have the runtime faster so the code could be used to run over a larger stock tickers that could be added to the tickers array,however the two codes ran in a similar amount of time.
