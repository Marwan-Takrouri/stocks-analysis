# stocks-analysis
***Project overview:***
The main purpose of this analysis is to help Steve’s parents decide on which green energy stocks they should invest. Steve would like to help his parents not only to decide on which stocks to invest but also to ensure making a good return on their investment. Steve’s parents are precisely interested to invest on Stock named DQ in Green energy. 
Analyzing with VBA has been widely used in the financial data sets. Through taking 2017,2018 data of the returns on prices of the DQ stock and all the other stocks, we will be able to help Steve and his parents to make a comparison so they can make their final decision.


***Analysis Summary :***

As we can see in the following screen shots of the VBA coding, we run on 2017, 2018 and then with the refactored code we can clearly see and share with Steve and his Parents the below outcomes:
In 2017 the DQ stock returns with about 199%, while in 2018 it dropped with 62.6%. This indicates that the best return was in 2017 and the lowest is in 2018.
While taking in consideration the return of investment; it is better to avoid DQ stocks and investing in ENPH instead.
Debugging for the refactor is takes long time as it seems repetitive, and the arrays looks like the original code.
During the original coding and analysis, we did analyze the data for 2017,2018, and then debugging the code we measured the time elapsed to execute the code as follow:

With the refactoring, we can see clearly in the screen shots, as the elapsed time was less than the original code, in my opinion the coding itself took longer to be written as we did create 4 different arrays in the coding.

***Results :***

In 2017 the DQ stock returns with about 199% , while in 2018 it dropped with 62.6%.
It was the best return in 2017 and the lowest in 2018.
While taking in consideration return of investment: it is better to avoid DQ and thinking on investing in ENPH instead.
